/**
 * Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets,
 * and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each
 * basket can have only one type of fruit.
 * <p>
 * You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. You will pick one
 * fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
 * <p>
 * Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket.
 * This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
 * <p>
 * Solution #
 * This problem follows the Sliding Window pattern and is quite similar to Longest Substring with K Distinct
 * Characters. In this problem, we need to find the length of the longest subarray with no more than two
 * distinct characters (or fruit types!). This transforms the current problem into Longest Substring with
 * K Distinct Characters where K=2.
